Opener: Worst Interview (20 min)
Pair off, spend 3 min telling your absolute worst job interview experience.  Then switch.
Afterward, introduce the other person and give 3 - 5 reasons why their job interview was so bad.

Intent:
* Capture main reasons why interviews go wrong, and what we are specifically looking to solve

Opener: In Their Shoes (Job Candidate)
* Form three groups
* You have one to think of all the approaches you take to getting a job
* Write them all down
* We'll read them out, the team with the most unique answers will win

** Think about all levels: beginning, intermediate, senior

Sourcing:
* Figure out what kinds of staff we're looking for
* How many people write their own vs having recruiters write them?
* What does a recruiter do?
* Where do you personally get most of your job


Interview Questions:
* Drop into Slack
